Visualisation provides a pictorial way to represent both spatial and abstract data. Recently, many artists have started using AI-generated visuals as references for their work. In an instant, an idea—however complex or difficult to grasp—can be brought to life using AI tools. This not only enhances artworks but also expands human imagination. Artists use these visuals as inspiration, helping them to develop fresh ideas and create original concepts in entirely new styles, thus widening the boundaries of artistic expression.

While some argue that AI stifles human creativity and undervalues genuine effort, the sheer convenience of using it is hard to ignore. No time is spent thinking about layout, composition, colour, or perspective. One simply has an idea, and it is instantly produced. The debate between those who support AI in art and those who oppose it continues, with both sides offering valid points. Still, for the growth of human creativity, it may be better to translate our own ideas into art, rather than relying solely on machine-generated work.
