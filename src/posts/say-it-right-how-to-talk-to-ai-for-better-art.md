AI is smart, but it requires clear instructions from the user, too. The better you talk to it, the better your image turns out to be. Try being more specific and say what's in your mind as much as you can. Instead of saying "make a cool painting," try "make a painting depicting a colourful sunset over a mountain, in watercolour style." Here are some details you can add tot your prompt…

- Style (watercolour, realistic, cyberpunk)
- Colours (bright red sky, golden car headlights)
- Mood (peaceful, gloomy, dark)
- Props (any objects or characters you want to see in the result)

The more clear and creative you are, the more amazing your result will be. So don’t be shy, say it right, and watch the magic happen!
