AI’s potential to shape a new design paradigm is vast and hard to fully grasp. It can assist designers and artists in countless ways. AI blends different design elements, thus making a fusion of cultural artworks, raising entirely new styles and expressions. Here are a few popular tools used for image generation…

1. ChatGPT: Previously powered by DALLE-2, ChatGPT is an LLM that behaves like a chatbot. It can generate images during textual chat.
2. Midjourney: Midjourney's primer is image generation, allowing its users to create well-imaginated pieces of digit art.
3. Stable Diffusion: Thankfully open source, it is fully customisable and usable offline. It generates realistic images based on the prompt.

However, while AI enables the creation of bold and innovative designs, these cultural blends may sometimes cross sensitive boundaries — especially in religious or national contexts — potentially hurting sentiments and sparking backlash. Thus, the use of AI in design must be both creative and culturally mindful.
