Depending on which side you stand, cultural legacy is either being thoughtfully used or wrongly exploited to create machine-curated, seemingly perfect responses. This raises serious concerns about intellectual property rights (IPR) and ownership of artistic and cultural works. While AI can mimic style, tone, and content, it can never truly replace the creativity and originality of the human mind — whether in technology or in culture.

So, what’s the way forward as the unstoppable wave of AI continues?

We need a **deliberate and balanced approach** — one that ensures machines serve human thought, not dominate it. AI systems must be built with stronger safeguards, clear respect for IPR, and an appreciation of human effort. If left unchecked, AI could become a platform for cultural manipulation, irresponsible tech use, and even harmful outcomes — posing real threats to human society, much like **Skynet in the Terminator series**.
